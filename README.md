# PyTorch General Bessel Functions
## Aims
The aim of this repository is to provide a library of Bessel functions of complex argument and real order, that are compatible with PyTorch autograd.
The idea is to reimplement the AMOS/SLATEC libraries that SciPy calls to for special function evaluations.
